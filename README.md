# UFOs
### OVERVIEW

The purpose of the analysis is to build an HTML page that pulls information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. This is done by using a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data that is more than just the date. 

### RESULTS

Using the code and the new html website, user will be able to filter data by inputting a criteria into a filter field. As a response, the webpage will automatically filter the table to display relevant data.

The web page now has a left column for different filters:

### SUMMARY
###### Drawback:

One of the major drawbacks of the new design is that there are no resizing options. This means that no matter the screen size of the mobile device, it will show up the same size but that also means it will not fit some of the sizes. As such, 

###### Recommendations:

1. Would be to add formatting which readjusts the sections and margins when the page is viewed on a mobile device or tablet.
2. To expand the webpage user survey so it can be constantly receiving feedback and the developers can be improving the webpage as we go.
